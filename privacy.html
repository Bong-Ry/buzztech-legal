<h1>Privacy Policy for Trend Analysis</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2025-04-29</em></p> <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [Your Name or Company Name] ("Operator", "we", "our", "us") collects, uses, and shares information in connection with your use of our Trend Analysis service (the "Service"), which utilizes the TikTok API (specifically targeting the Research API) to retrieve publicly available video data for marketing analysis.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect via TikTok API</h2>
<p>The Service interacts with the TikTok API (primarily the Research API, subject to approval and availability) to collect publicly available data about TikTok videos based on specified criteria (e.g., region, trending status based on likes/comments). The data we aim to collect includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Video Metadata:</strong> Video ID, video description, creation timestamp, region code, music ID, hashtags, challenges, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Aggregated Engagement Data:</strong> Publicly displayed counts like like count, comment count, share count, and view count associated with videos.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Author Information:</strong> Publicly available author ID and author nickname associated with the videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not intend to collect sensitive personal information or non-public data. The collection is limited to data made publicly available by users on the TikTok platform and accessible via the authorized TikTok API endpoints requested.</p>
<p>We may also collect operational logs (e.g., API request logs, error logs) for the purpose of maintaining and debugging the Service itself. These logs are typically anonymized or pseudonymized and used solely for technical purposes.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
<p>The data collected via the TikTok API is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To identify and retrieve trending TikTok videos in specified overseas regions based on public engagement metrics.</li>
  <li>To perform internal marketing analysis and understand content trends.</li>
  <li>To operate, maintain, and improve the functionality of the Service.</li>
  <li>To detect and prevent misuse of the API or the Service.</li>
  <li>To comply with applicable legal obligations and TikTok's API Terms of Service and Developer Policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use the collected data for user profiling for advertising, direct marketing to individuals, or any purpose other than the internal analysis described.</p>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell the data collected via the TikTok API.</p>
<p>We may share information under the following limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>With TikTok:</strong> Data is inherently received from TikTok via their API. Our use is governed by their terms.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use third-party service providers for hosting (e.g., cloud infrastructure providers) or other technical operations. These providers are bound by confidentiality obligations and only process data on our behalf and under our instructions.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) enforce our agreements with you; (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (d) protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (e) exercise or protect the rights and safety of the Operator, our personnel, or others.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain the collected TikTok data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the marketing analysis purposes described above, or as required by applicable law or TikTok's policies. After this period, the data is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

<h2>5. Your Rights & Data Subject Requests</h2>
<p>The data we collect is primarily public information from the TikTok platform. If you believe we hold information about you (e.g., as a video creator whose public video data was retrieved) and wish to exercise potential data subject rights (such as access, correction, or deletion) under applicable data protection laws (like GDPR or CCPA), please contact us. We will assess the request in accordance with applicable laws and TikTok's platform policies.</p>

<h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect data from children via the TikTok API. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected data from a child, we will take steps to delete such information promptly.</p>

<h2>7. Security</h2>
<p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the security of the data we collect and store. This includes measures like encryption (in transit and potentially at rest), access controls, and secure development practices. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>

<h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
<p>The data we collect may be processed and stored on servers located outside of your country of residence, where data protection laws may differ. We take steps to ensure that data transfers comply with applicable legal requirements, such as using standard contractual clauses where necessary.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our data practices.</p>
